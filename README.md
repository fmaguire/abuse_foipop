# FOIPOP Abuse Analysis

Sheilla Wildeman Email:

 What you see are 
1) my decision letter, which I include because it shows you precisely what I asked for; 
2) the form 7 appeal form (ignore that -- I toyed with the idea of seeking more info but it is a losing battle I think and this already took a year and $500 - but if you have thoughts on that given other experience with FOIPOP please say!); and 
3) the data set.  

The main thing I am asking for your help on is pages 301-303 of the data set.  That is their summary of the info, which I admit is not super user friendly from my point of view.  

The data set itself you can ignore, although I figured having it there may help you understand better what the summary reflects.  Please do not think I am asking you to pore through the (mostly redacted) forms up to page 301.

Back to doc 1, "decision", again this shows what I asked for -- namely, info on a few types of reports of abuse under the Protection of Persons in Care Act, under particular subsections of the Act, running from Jan 1 2018 to Jan 31 2021.  

I picked the types of complain most likely to include staff-on-resident use of restraints or seclusion.  This would include any instances of 'chemical restraint' meaning use of sedative medications for behaviour control. (I think in the whole thing there was only one or maybe two of those, on my quick scan of the actual -- heavily redacted -- reports).

Further, I asked for all documents relating to these complaints, including whether there was an investigation, the investigation reports, whether the claim was deemed founded, and what if any directives or other action resulted.

I made the request in Jan 2021.  I hoped to discern whether there were any trends in reporting, investigation or directives in the covid period to then, in these kinds of cases.  

It is restricted to Dept of Community Services licensed facilities.  That means nursing homes / continuing care licensed under Health are not included.  I am working on disability issues touching mainly on DCS although I wish now I had DHW included.  It cost about $500 just for DCS (which they reduced from $850 at the start) and I imagine there are at least 3 times more volume of info from DHW.  

From what I can tell, there are no clear trends.  There is plenty of interesting information though.

So:  I would be interested in whether one can tell, 

    did investigations decrease or happen more slowly during covid 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019?  
    Were there more incidents reported under any of the statutory headers? (I then have to dive into the reports themselves to figure out what these actually were; I wish they had organized the reports by date.).
    Were there more / fewer cases deemed founded, and/or directives issued, during covid? 
    How many reports come from staff and how many from residents? Patterns there? (I had trouble discerning whether they are even giving me this, or if they are only showing me who they deemed their primary witness)
    How many times did resident-sourced complaints succeed versus staff-sourced?
    Are there other notable things to be drawn in terms of trends?

I figure I might ask for the same data for 2021.  

OK that is what I have!  Thanks for anything you can contribute.  If you can keep this to yourself basically for now that would be great.  Although soon the data will come out.
